## Project
Command-line tool to create random matrices over finite fields that have a Jordan normal form

## Usage
Running the file "wrapper.py" tasks a generated and managed with commands:</br>
showing currently used ids:
> \>> ids

generating a task with the matrix being of the shape a x a and the field having p elements:
> \>> generate p a

getting the matrix M under the identifier id (a number):
> \>> get id

getting the solution of the task under the identifier id:
> \>> sol id

deleting the taks with identifier id:
> \>> del id

ending the programm:
> \>> end
